## Introduction 

The project "Melantha" means to be a simple HTTP web server implementation for 
practice. It ought to be simple and easy to understand as it is originally the 
assignment of my computer network course at my university. 

Back to `melantha-rs` itself. `melantha-rs` is a re-implementation of the original 
["Melantha" project](), and it's written in Rust instead of C. I start this project 
not far after I finished reading a Rust programming tutorial, which contains a 
similar network server project as its final quiz. Considering their similarity, 
I choose to re-implement my old "Melantha" project as the finish of my first-step 
Rust learning. I know my Melantha will never fails me.
